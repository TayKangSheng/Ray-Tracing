No collaboration with anyone. The only helped i received is from Germaine, when i was running into issues with addition of the random float value for jitter sampling. It turned out that i should add the random float value before retrieving pixel coordinates as all pixel coordinates are normalised to between -1 and 1. 

Referenced course slides for all the formulas and pseudo codes.

No known problems with code as far as my eyes can tell. I managed to finish the basic implementation of the code.

Did not implement any extra credits.

This assignment was slightly more fun as it did not need me to read through a new set of starter source code and spend a whole lot of time trying to understand what is going on. Spent an entire day getting stuck on a bug to realise i did not normalise the direction vector. Other than that… pretty cool assignment…
